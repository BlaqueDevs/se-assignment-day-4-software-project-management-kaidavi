## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
How Effective Cost Control Contributes to Project Success
Ensures Financial Feasibility: Keeping costs within budget allows the project to proceed without exhausting resources. It enables the project to deliver value without requiring additional funding, which can strain the organization.
Enhances Stakeholder Confidence: A well-managed budget demonstrates competence and instills trust in stakeholders, from investors to clients, by showing that the project team can deliver within constraints.
Improves Project Predictability: Controlled costs lead to more accurate forecasting, making it easier to assess project risks, timelines, and resource needs, which in turn supports better planning and delivery.
Increases ROI: Efficient cost management means more resources can be allocated to other projects or phases, ultimately leading to a higher return on investment for the company.
Minimizes Risk of Project Failure: By avoiding unnecessary spending, the project is less likely to run out of funds or require compromises on quality or scope, reducing the risk of failure.
Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
Accurate Budget Estimation: At the outset, use historical data, detailed requirements, and expert input to estimate costs. Break down the budget into smaller components (labor, materials, tools, etc.) for better visibility and control.
Prioritize Requirements: Define must-have features versus nice-to-have features to avoid scope creep. Clear prioritization helps manage changes and ensures that essential elements are delivered within budget.
Continuous Monitoring and Reporting: Regularly track expenses against the budget and set up key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor cost variance. Project management tools, like JIRA or Microsoft Project, can automate this process and keep the team informed.
Use Agile Methodologies: Agile’s iterative development process helps teams prioritize features, make adjustments, and reassess costs frequently, reducing the risk of going over budget due to changing requirements.
Implement Change Control Processes: Any changes in scope should go through a formal process where cost implications are assessed. This avoids unexpected expenses and enables stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Optimize Resource Allocation: Assign resources based on their skills and experience to minimize the time and effort required for each task. This strategy also includes outsourcing or using contractors for specific tasks if it’s cost-effective.
Plan for Contingencies: Reserve a percentage of the budget for unforeseen expenses. This buffer helps absorb unexpected costs without compromising the project’s overall budget.
Limit Project Scope and Avoid Scope Creep: Clearly define project boundaries and adhere to them. Scope creep is a common cause of budget overruns, so enforcing scope discipline is crucial.
Regular Communication with Stakeholders: Frequent updates keep stakeholders informed and aligned, reducing the likelihood of misaligned expectations that can lead to budget adjustments or overruns.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall: Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach. Projects move through defined phases—such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—in a set order. Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, with little or no overlap between them.
Agile: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach. Projects are broken into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations, which are typically 1-4 weeks long. Each sprint includes phases like planning, development, and testing, allowing teams to deliver functional parts of the project continuously.
